### Technologies Used:
- HTML & CSS
- Vue.js
- Express
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Passport (Local Strategy Login/Registration)

### Learning Outcome:
Through this project I got more experience in setting up a client side with Vue.js and the server side with Express and Node.js. MongoDB was used to store data. RESTFUL actions are used; CRUD structured server. There is a login/registration functionality implemented as well where Passport was used as middleware along with it's 'local' strategy.

This project was also done along with two other students. Teamwork composed of communicating efficiently in order to use a single Github repo and meet a project deadline on time.

### Potential Improvements:
- Attributing ID's to different schemas using the populate method.
- Storing/Retrieving Images using an AWS S3 bucket for better load times
- Organize data in different mongoose.Schemas as needed.
